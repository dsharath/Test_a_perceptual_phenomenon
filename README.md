# Test_a_perceptual_phenomenon
In this project, we are conducting a Stroop tests on the sample population and using descriptive statistics to
find which test the people are familiar with. 

The following steps are used to find the perspective result:
1) A brief description of a data to find dependant and independent variables.
2) Finding the mean, standard deviation, and standard error.
3) The suitable test is validated to find the critical intervals on sample data.
4) Hypothesis and Alternative hypothesis are explained in descriptively.
5) Resulted in the critical values, p-value, and degree of freedom.
6) All the results are shown in the graph for stating the practical and theoretical difference.


Finally, the practical values are very near to the theoretical 
stated in the conclusion.
